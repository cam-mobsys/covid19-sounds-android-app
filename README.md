This is the repository for the COVID-19 Sounds Android app: https://covid-19-sounds.org/en/.

The app starts with an initial (one time) survey where the user is asked to enter information pertaining to their demograhics: age, gender, smoking habits, and a brief medical history after providing their consent. The user is then regularly (2 days) asked to fill a survey regarding their testing status, symptoms, whether they are in hospital followed by recording their respiratory sounds: cough three times, deep breaths through their mouth three to five times and reading a short sentence appearing on the phone screen three times. Finally, a location sample is gathered with permission. 

Please note that the app does not provide any clinical advice or results at this point.

Note: The code is compilable but you would need a server to be setup (to collect app's data) and link the server information (Such as OAuth and secret keys) with the app code to make it work on your end.
